# Portfolio

A fun website application that is under development might host my actual portfolio.  
I will post different projects and further develop the website as my confidence grows.


## Running the test environment

Link to script [run.sh](run.sh) that will start a .venv and run an automatic updater for the website so that you can test changes in real time. 

Application is built with Django and TailwindCSS.
