A fun website application that is under development might host my actual portfolio.  
I will post different projects and further develop the website as my confidence grows.

## Folder structure

```bash
portfolio
├── LICENSE
├── README.md              
├── website                     # The html folder
├── graphic                     # TailwindCSS config
├── manage.py                   # Django test manager
├── media                       # Different media if needed, (eg. pdf)
├── portfolio                   # Django project
├── requirements.txt            # Django configurations used
└── run.sh                      # Simple script to run website
```

## Testing

Link to script [run.sh](run.sh) that will start a .venv and run an automatic updater for the website so that you can test changes in real time.

Application is run with Django and TailwindCSS
